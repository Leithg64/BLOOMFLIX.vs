          <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third film in the Indiana Jones series. Released in 1989, 
          it was directed by Steven Spielberg. Although it was the third motion picture released, the movie is 
          chapter twenty-five in The Complete Adventures of Indiana Jones.
          Set two years after the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the story follows archaeologist Indiana Jones 
          as he discovers his estranged father has gone missing while seeking out clues leading to the Holy Grail. 
          Guided in his search by his father's diary, Jones learns that the Nazis are also interested in the Biblical cup, 
          and must overcome them to be reunited with his parent.</em>
